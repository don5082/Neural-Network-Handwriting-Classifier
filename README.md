**I am focused on actually learning the material, NOT just creating a project for my resume. This information is critical to know for my LLM research, so I am taking the time to learn and understand**

I am learning how to create neural networks. I am following the tutorial at https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/ to build the network in order to solve the problem of handwritten digit classification.
